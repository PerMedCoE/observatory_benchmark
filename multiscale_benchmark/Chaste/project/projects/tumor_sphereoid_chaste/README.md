# A template user project for use with Chaste.

You now simply click the big green "Use this template" button to use a copy of this repository as the basis of your own new repository under your github username/organisation (this 'template' status avoids complications with forks all being linked back to this repo).

Alternatively, if you aren't a github user, you can download a zip (see Releases button) and start your own repository with that.

Then see the [User Projects](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ChasteGuides/UserProjects) guide page on the Chaste wiki for more information.
