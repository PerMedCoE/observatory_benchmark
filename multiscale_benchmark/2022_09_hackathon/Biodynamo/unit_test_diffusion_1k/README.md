# BDM large scale diffusion

This folder implements the small scale diffusion test. To run, you need to have 
BioDynaMo sourced and be in the folder `code_scripts/diffusion-large`. Then, 
simply execute `bdm run` in your terminal. You'll find the results in 
`code_scripts/diffusion-large/output`.

Alternatively, execute the script `run.sh` which checks if BDM is sourced, 
executes the simulation, and moves the results to the results directory.
